					<ContentText title="How Donations Support ASOT">
						<Typography>There are expenses for running a community such as ASOT which can add up to quite a bit over the year. In no way do we expect members to donate to the community and it is not a joining requirement.</Typography>
					</ContentText>

					<ContentText title="What is a Donation?">
						<Typography>A donation is a gift given without return consideration. This means that, you as the donator, expect no returned item to be given now or in the future.</Typography>
					</ContentText>

					<ContentText title="How does ASOT use donations?">
						<Typography>All donations given to ASOT enter an account used to pay for server related bills such as; the Virtual Server, ArmA clans, teamspeak licenses, and website domains.</Typography>
					</ContentText>

					<ContentText title="Where do I donate?">
						<Typography>Donate via the secure Paypal donation button above. This will take you off our site and process your donation.</Typography>
